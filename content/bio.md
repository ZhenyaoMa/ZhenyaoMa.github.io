I am Zhenyao Ma (马镇尧, Jen-yow Ma), a researcher in human behavior, complex social systems, and machine learning. I am curious about, and my research focuses on:

- How humans execute behavior and make decisions? (behavioral and experimental economics)
- How complex social systems operate? (equilibrium theory and complex systems)
- Behavioral-science–prior machine learning.
