  abstract = {We develop a rational-choice framework that can explain why behavior might appear selfish in some contexts while pro-social in others, even if the underlying social preferences themselves are stable. Our model characterizes that expression of social preferences (active social consideration) is endogenous to the complexity of the decision problem. We design experiments to test the theory.}
